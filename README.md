# Cookie-clicker

Cookie clicker project

I went for a Big red button approach for my cookie clicker project (Because who desnt love pushing a big red button that theyre not supposed to push?)

As I am struggling with remembering a lot of the javaScript side I used previous workshops, Google and the course demos to help with writing some elements of the projects but overall I found this project to be quite simple.

I have attached a wireframe design to the project files (I drew the whole thing myself in Aseprite)

There is a giant button in the middle of the screen and a counter that increases incrementally every second as well as increases every time the button is clicked

I struggled a lot with implementing local storage as the workshop for that was really confusing but with help I managed to get local storage working (It saves and restores the amount of "infringements") - Thank you to Jez and Heinry for the help with fixing it

"Infringements" is the name for the amount of clicks on the button made (You're breaking the rules everytime you click it you little rebel)

The button has some CSS styling that makes it look animated when clicked

I have implemented min-width so the webpage is viewable on mobile devices

I have also made a request to the supplied upgrade API

As someone who has always wanted to make games I will maybe continue to improve on this project in my spare time (Will also serve my portfolio well)

Overall I have completed every goal that was set for this project and a few stretch goals
